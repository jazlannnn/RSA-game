# Interactive RSA Game

## Introduction

The Interactive RSA Game is an educational game built to help users understand RSA 
encryption through a series of challenges. The game uses encryption and decryption problems 
to let players move between levels which replicate RSA cryptographic procedures. Users can 
participate in a Time Attack Mode which requires them to solve RSA-related problems as fast 
as they can. Players can join score competitions while the system maintains the best results 
within the leaderboard system. 

Technologies Used : YOLOv5, Pytorch, ONNX, Tensorflow, TFLite, Flutter, Firebase
