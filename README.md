# Interactive RSA Game

## Introduction

The Interactive RSA Game is an educational game built to help users understand RSA 
encryption through a series of challenges. The game uses encryption and decryption problems 
to let players move between levels which replicate RSA cryptographic procedures. Users can 
participate in a Time Attack Mode which requires them to solve RSA-related problems as fast 
as they can. Players can join score competitions while the system maintains the best results 
within the leaderboard system. 

Technologies Used : Python, PyQt5, SQLite3, CSS, Crypthographic

## Conclusion
The Interactive RSA Game is a fun and educational Python-based application that helps users learn how RSA encryption works. It was built using Python 3 and PyQt5 for the interface, with a dark “hacker-style” design featuring green text and a black background. The game has two modes: a guided RSA mode and a Time Attack mode where players solve problems quickly. It teaches users how to choose prime numbers, generate RSA keys, encrypt messages, and decrypt them. A SQLite3 database stores high scores, and the RSA logic (including key generation and encryption/decryption) is written from scratch using basic math functions. Overall, it’s a great project that combines learning, coding, and gameplay in a simple and interactive way.
